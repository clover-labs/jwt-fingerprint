# JWT Fingerprint Authentication

This is a example GoLang implentation of JWT authentication using fingerprints deployed on AWS Lambda using AWS SAM:

This application implements JWT authentication including registration,login,silent login and fetching endpoints and shows usage of fingerprint for securing JWT token authentication. For explanation of the code please visit the BLOG POST.


## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with Administrator permission
* [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
* [Golang](https://golang.org)
* SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)

## Setup process

### Installing dependencies & building the target 

In this example we use the built-in `sam build` to automatically download all the dependencies and package our build target.   
Read more about [SAM Build here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-build.html) 

The `sam build` command is wrapped inside of the `Makefile`. To execute this simply run
 
```shell
make
```

### Local development

**Invoking function locally through local API Gateway**

```bash
sam local start-api
```

If the previous command ran successfully you should now be able to hit the following local endpoint to invoke your function `http://localhost:3000/hello`


To deploy your application for the first time, run the following in your shell:

```bash
sam deploy --guided
```


# Appendix

### Golang installation

Please ensure Go 1.x (where 'x' is the latest version) is installed as per the instructions on the official golang website: https://golang.org/doc/install

A quickstart way would be to use Homebrew, chocolatey or your linux package manager.

#### Homebrew (Mac)

Issue the following command from the terminal:

```shell
brew install golang
```

If it's already installed, run the following command to ensure it's the latest version:

```shell
brew update
brew upgrade golang
```

#### Chocolatey (Windows)

Issue the following command from the powershell:

```shell
choco install golang
```

If it's already installed, run the following command to ensure it's the latest version:

```shell
choco upgrade golang
```
